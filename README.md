# How to use middleware and context?
There are three routers: `basicRouter`, `authRouter` and `petRouter`.

`basicRouter` router is a really basic router, which is not wrapped into any middleware and handles user login, registration and logout.

`authRouter` router is wrapped into `AuthMiddleware` middleware. 
This router takes one parameter with type `*models.RefreshTokenStore`, which
is responsible for an access to database and operations on corresponding table.
This middleware checks whether user is authenticated or not.  
`authRouter := router.PathPrefix("/").Subrouter()`
`authRouter.Use(authentication.AuthMiddleware(&storeRefreshToken, &storeUser))`
 
 `petRouter` is a subrouter of `authRouter` and it is wrapped into `PetMiddleware`.
The point of this router is to restrict users from certain endpoints that are only allowed to users, who have registered their pets.
It takes one parameter with type `*models.UserStore`.

If you want to wrap your handler in middleware, you should simply handle functions on router like this:  
`authRouter.HandleFunc("/mypage", controller.MyPageGetHandler()).Methods("GET")`

Context is passed to handler from middleware and there is one key - `id`. 
`id` is an int value and it represents an id of logged in user.
Get user_id in your handlers like this:  
`context.Get(r, "id").(int)`
